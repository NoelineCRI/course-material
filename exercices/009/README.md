# Counting Words

Introduces: split, list, len.

## Instructions

Provide the script `solution.py` that prints the number of words of the paragraph:

```python
phantom_menace = """Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The\
 taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in\
 dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly\
 battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to\
 the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic\
 endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme\
 Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of\
 peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict"""
```

(You should copy the paragraph to your script.)


## Advice

A string is also a list.

Take a look at the method [`split`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split).
